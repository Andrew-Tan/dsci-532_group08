# Reflection

### What we have implemented in our dashboard so far

Our [mental health in tech dashboard](https://dsci532-viz-g8.herokuapp.com/) currently consists of 4 plots and 4 filtering functionalities. Plots include a geographical map of the USA, a histogram for `Age` distribution, and bar charts for `Interference with work`, and `Wellness program`. Filtering options include a slider for `age` range selection and drop-down menus for features such as `state`, `company size`, and `gender`. All the plots and filtering functions mentioned above are on the "General Overview" tab, the "Company support" tab is reserved for further improvements and explorations in milestone4.

### What we know is not working in our dashboard

After trying and navigating through our app, we didn't encounter any obvious bug. You will notice that the second tab is blank as we mentioned on the previous section. Other than that, the app is working properly when filtering as well as in full-screen mode.

### What we think our dashboard does well what its limitations are

The app is designed with simple and intuitively plots so that the average person without prior knowledge can easily operate and find insights. The filtering options located on the left-hand side work cohesively with the graphics to allow flexible and customizable plots. As our data is limited to the survey responses at the country and state level, our geographical map and analyses cannot break down insights for districts or cities.

### what are good future improvements and additions

Future improvements and additions include populating the "Company support" tab with graphics that convey company aspects and actions toward mental health conditions. In fact, one of our current plots (`Wellness program`) will be moved to the second tab. Style and formatting of the plots as well as aligning font size, better axis names and plot titles will definitely be part of our upcoming improvements.
